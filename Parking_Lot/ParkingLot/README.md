Optimized Parking Lot System: 
This project implements a parking lot management system using object-oriented principles and the Observer Design Pattern. The system allows for the parking and unparking of different types of vehicles (Motorcycles, Cars, and Trucks) while keeping track of available parking spots. It is optimized for real-time updates and notifications regarding parking availability.
